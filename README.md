# Deques-and-Randomized-Queues-algs4
My solution for programming assignment "Deques and Randomized Queues" at Algorithms, Part I by Princeton University.

Solution uses other classes provided by Princeton: StdOut.java, StdIn.java, StdRandom.java. Look for them at edu.princeton.cs.algs4.*
Programming assignment itself can be found here: https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php
